# Weapon Overhaul Mod

Nobody likes useless legendary items. I personally hate throwing away a large number of weapons. It irks me. So, I decided to change that.

This mod changes the damage values of a large number of weapons (almost all legendary weapons), as many feel unusable after a certain point (I'm looking at you, Lucian's Call).

This WILL affect game balance significantly, but will also make previously useless weapons feel good and takedown weapons feel powerful. Very, very powerful.

You can find a table with the values I'm adjusting below:

This mod is very much so a WIP, so thing's will NOT be balanced. I created the values based on how they feel/feedback I get from people. Any and all feedback is appreciated, as it'll allow me to better balance weapons out. After all, we don't want to end up with another Free Radical.

If anything feels broken/OP or underpowered, please contact me on Discord. I need feedback to really nail down the balance.

ONE FINAL NOTE

I will get to the DLC's in due time. Please don't come yelling at me about stuff like "MuH FAvoRItE gUN iSN't GoOd yEt".  Bitch, I do this shit fo free, so don't get your panties in a wad. And don't yell at me like "YoU RUinEd tHE gAMe" - you're the one who download this mod, YOU wanted this. I just provided it to you. If you don't like it, learn how to code and fine tune it to your liking. That's what I did - I got sick of a lot of items not being viable so I said "I can fix that". And now we're here.

# Changelog

To find what weapons are buffed/nerfed, please refer to the spreadsheet above (also WIP). See the individual tab you want for a specific weapon (IE Base Pistol DMG). Weapons in yellow are currently not working and I need to rework. 

Items highlighted in green are buffed, and red are nerfed.

#

0.1.8 - Re-balanced base game snipers.

0.1.7 - Balanced base game shotguns. Only 1 isn't working (the redline).

0.1.6 - Balanced base game assault rifles. Some don't work and are noted in the mod and the spreadsheet. I will come back to these. For now, I'm going to continue to lay the groundwork for all guns.

0.1.5 - Completely rebalanced all pistols and SMG's. Buff values can be found on the spreadsheet in the corresponding sheet (ie Base SMG DMG or Base Pistol DMG)

0.1.3 - Balanced Atlas, COV and Dahl pistols. Dahl AAA doesn't work currently.

0.1.2 - Balanced sniper damage values to be positive

0.1.1 - Added shotguns and snipers.
