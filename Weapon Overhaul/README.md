# Weapon Overhaul Mod

This mod changes the damage values of a large number of weapons (almost all legendary weapons), as many feel unusable after a certain point (I'm looking at you, Lucian's Call).

This WILL affect game balance significantly, but will also make previously useless weapons feel good.

You can find a table with the values I'm adjusting below:

This mod is very much so a WIP, so thing's will NOT be balanced at all. I created the values based on how they feel.
Any and all feedback is appreciated, as it'll allow me to better balance weapons out. After all, we don't want to end up with another Free Radical.

If anything feels broken/OP or underpowered, please contact me on Discord.
