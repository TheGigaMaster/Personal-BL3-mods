# Weapon Overhaul Mod

Nobody likes useless legendary items. I personally hate throwing away a large number of weapons. It irks me. So, I decided to change that.

This mod changes the damage values of a large number of weapons (almost all legendary weapons), as many feel unusable after a certain point (I'm looking at you, Lucian's Call).

This WILL affect game balance significantly, but will also make previously useless weapons feel good and takedown weapons feel powerful. Very, very powerful.

You can find a table with the values I'm adjusting below:

This mod is very much so a WIP, so thing's will NOT be balanced at all. I created the values based on how they feel.
Any and all feedback is appreciated, as it'll allow me to better balance weapons out. After all, we don't want to end up with another Free Radical.

If anything feels broken/OP or underpowered, please contact me on Discord.

# Changelog

To find what weapons are buffed/nerfed, please refer to the spreadsheet above (also WIP). See the individual tab you want for a specific weapon (IE Base Pistol DMG). Weapons in yellow are currently not working and I need to rework. 

Items highlighted in green are buffed, and red are nerfed.

#

0.1.8 - Re-balanced base game snipers.

0.1.7 - Balanced base game shotguns. Only 1 isn't working (the redline).

0.1.6 - Balanced base game assault rifles. Some don't work and are noted in the mod and the spreadsheet. I will come back to these. For now, I'm going to continue to lay the groundwork for all guns.

0.1.5 - Completely rebalanced all pistols and SMG's. Buff values can be found on the spreadsheet in the corresponding sheet (ie Base SMG DMG or Base Pistol DMG)

0.1.3 - Balanced Atlas, COV and Dahl pistols. Dahl AAA doesn't work currently.

0.1.2 - Balanced sniper damage values to be positive

0.1.1 - Added shotguns and snipers.

0.1.0 - First unofficial release. Includes changes to legendary base game pistols, SMG's, and AR's. This is designed to lay the foundation/groundwork of how this mod will be made. Values will NOT be balanced very well, if at all.
