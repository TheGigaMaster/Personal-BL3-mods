# Values to buff/change
For this mod, I want to make the following changes: 

Normal Mode:

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 90%

Increase adult to badass from 30% to 45%

Increase badass to superbadass from 10% to 15%

Increase superbadass to raid from 0% to 5%

#

TVHM:

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 100% TVHM

Increase adult to badass from 40% to 80% TVHM

Increase badass to superbadass from 20% to 40% TVHM

Increase superbadass to ultimate badass (AKA Raid) from 10% to 20% TVHM 

I'm pretty sure once we get the new raid boss, the part of "superbadass -> raid" will become active, but we'll see.
