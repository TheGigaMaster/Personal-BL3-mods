# Varkid Evolution Chance Increase

Tired of varkids never leveling up and evolving? Ever think you should not be able to just run over these creatures?

Bored of not worrying about having to take them out quick? If so, this mod is for you!

On normal mode, evolution chance is increased by ~50%, and on TVHM, evolution chance is ~doubled. 

Although the code is in the mod, it is not set up for multiplayer yet, so it will only affect single player sessions.

No health adjustments were made, only changes to evolution rate were adjusted.

Normal Mode

The aim of normal mode was to make badasses more frequent and to rarely fight larva. 
Becuase let's be honest, no one wants to fight larva. Unless you've just stared a new game or are going in undergeared.
These changes are aimed to make varkid's a good source of fun and XP.

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 90%

Increase adult to badass from 30% to 45%

Increase badass to superbadass from 10% to 15%

Increase superbadass to raid from 0% to 5% (currently not in game)

TVHM

On TVHM, you'd better be ready. Mama isn't holding your hand anymore, the gloves are coming off.
You'd better pray you don't run into a Super Badass level difficulty as soon as you start TVHM and are undergeared.
Kill fast or get killed.

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 100% TVHM

Increase adult to badass from 40% to 80% TVHM

Increase badass to superbadass from 20% to 40% TVHM

Increase superbadass to ultimate badass (AKA Raid) from 10% to 20% TVHM (currently not in game)

I'm pretty sure once we get the new raid boss, the part of "superbadass -> raid" will become active, but we'll see.

#

Future idea - increase all spawns to make ultimate badass 75%+ and "Raid" 50%. Daddy has the belt in hand.
And he is not taking no for an answer.

Future idea - normal enemies can jump into pods and evolve. IE a tink can jump into a pod and evolve into a badass tink.
Tink's have turrets, so idk how that would interact. that'd be a lot of work, but a lot of fun.
Certain enemies wouldn't be able to evolve such as goliaths, bosses, mini-bosses, etc.
imagine you're just running and gunning, then a normal enemies just upgrades.
