# Values to buff/change
For this mod, I want to make the following changes: 

Normal Mode:

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 90%

Increase adult to badass from 30% to 45%

Increase badass to superbadass from 10% to 15%

Increase superbadass to raid from 0% to 5%

#

TVHM:

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 100% TVHM

Increase adult to badass from 40% to 80% TVHM

Increase badass to superbadass from 20% to 40% TVHM

Increase superbadass to ultimate badass (AKA Raid) from 10% to 20% TVHM

I'm pretty sure once we get the new raid boss, the part of "superbadass -> raid" will become active, but we'll see.

Future idea - increase all spawns to make ultimate badass 75%+ and "Raid" 50%. Daddy has the belt in hand.
And he is not taking no for an answer.

Future idea - normal enemies can jump into pods and evolve. IE a tink can jump into a pod and evolve into a badass tink.
Tink's have turrets, so idk how that would interact. that'd be a lot of work, but a lot of fun.
Certain enemies wouldn't be able to evolve such as goliaths, bosses, mini-bosses, etc.
imagine you're just running and gunning, then a normal enemies just upgrades.
