Tired of varkids never leveling up and evolving? Ever think you should not be able to just run over these creatures?
Bored of not worrying about having to take them out quick? If so, this mod is for you!
On normal mode, evolution chance is increased by 50%, and on TVHM, evolution chance is doubled. 
The time of evolution is not changed, and this is only for single player. This will not affect multiplayer, as those have different spawn values.



NORMAL MODE

The aim of normal mode was to make badasses more frequent and to rarely fight larva. 
Becuase let's be honest, no one wants to fight larva. Unless you've just stared a new game or are going in undergeared.
These changes are aimed to make varkid's a good source of fun and XP.

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 90%
Increase adult to badass from 30% to 45%
Increase badass to superbadass from 10% to 15%
Increase superbadass to raid from 0% to 5%



TVHM

On TVHM, you'd better be ready. Mama isn't holding your hand anymore, the gloves are coming off.
You'd better pray you don't run into a Super Badass level difficulty as soon as you start TVHM and are undergeared. Kill fast or get killed.

Increase larva to adult from 60% to 100% TVHM
Increase adult to badass from 40% to 80% TVHM
Increase badass to superbadass from 20% to 40% TVHM
Increase superbadass to ultimate badass (AKA Raid) from 10% to 20% TVHM 


This is the first time I've ever made a mod, let alone do anything involving code (excpet for printing Hello, World! in 9th grade).
So if things don't go quite as expected, don't be shocked when it breaks. Any feedback/tips/advice is appreciated! 
At some point, I may make variations of this mod to choose how hard you want it to be.



###

One interesting thing to note is that after super badass, the game says SuperToRaid for the final evolution stage. In BL2, it was a 3 step process:

super badass -> ultimate badass -> Verminvirous/supreme badass

In BL3, there is no ultimate badass stage.
Digging deeper, it appears that the game decides to go from

super badass -> Verminvirous/supreme badass

They are omitting an evolution stage.
Upon a quick look at the wiki, the spawn chance values for ultimate badass -> Verminvirous/Supreme badass match the vaules for the SuperToRaid chance.
This spawn rate is at 0% for normal mode and only a 7.5% chance in TVHM, which matches up with what's in the game data.

So, what does this mean?

The game is skipping an evolution step, and once a varkid reaches superbadass, it has a chance go straight to Raid. 
However, currently I don't think Raid is in the game, so we will have to wait and see what happens.
Have fun with going from "Ok this is a good challenge" to "God has abandoned us" by completely spiking in difficulty.


Future idea - increase all spawns to make ultimate badass 75%+ and "Raid" 50%. Daddy has the belt in hand.
And he is not taking no for an answer.

Future idea - normal enemies can jump into pods and evolve. IE a tink can jump into a pod and evolve into a badass tink.
Tink's have turrets, so idk how that would interact. that'd be a lot of work, but a lot of fun.
Certain enemies wouldn't be able to evolve such as goliaths, bosses, mini-bosses, etc.
imagine you're just running and gunning, then a normal enemies just upgrades.
